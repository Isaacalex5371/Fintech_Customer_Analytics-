"Although the UI is simple and easy to use. That does not mean anything if information is not consistent throughout the app, and most services are down most of the time. Also, I see that forcing the user to turn off Android Dev Settings to use the app is unnecessary and creates inconvenience for users who want to use their devices for Android development 🙄. If you have certain security requirements, you would rather prefer to restrict the minSdk (since recent android releases are secure).",1,2025-07-16,CBE,Google Play
"WHAT A USELESS APP! Transfers, wallet payments, other banks — nothing works. Updated, restarted, cleared cache, reinstalled — still useless. Crashed and forced me to visit a branch just to log in 3 times. One of the biggest banks in the country can’t fix issues a junior developer could solve. Completely unreliable. Big bank , Zero functionality!",1,2025-09-13,CBE,Google Play
"Most of the time when I try to open the app, it does not load. The circle keeps spinning as if it is trying to open, and get a message saying "" 2 attempts left for offline login"". This seems to mean that the app cannot connect to the internet, even though I have a stable internet connection, and all other stuff work properly.",2,2025-09-24,CBE,Google Play
"I use the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia mobile app, and it’s fantastic! The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to check balances and transfer money. I love the bill payment feature, and the security measures give me peace of mind. Overall, it’s a reliable app that has simplified my banking experience. Highly recommend!",5,2025-08-22,CBE,Google Play
"It is good app and really user friendly , but it not possible to start service after the app is uninstalled or device phone is changed. So please make it easy for us, after once you set us the requirements in your office we should have to use it only by install and launch it. We do not have to visit the near by branch office every time for such silly businesses but important things. in addition to that why is that for hidding senders name or account number How can I know who tranfers to me???",4,2025-09-05,CBE,Google Play
"I love this app. really, but with some downsides too. Screenshot is mandatory after every transaction as to me, I need screenshots not downloaded recipient. It would be even better if transaction history is available via this app for months that we can access directly or via calender ways. Thanks.",4,2025-08-22,CBE,Google Play
"The app was great while it was active. However, after the app did an update, I lost connection with a message ""Network Error"". Please try to fix it as there are many clients of CBE using this app globally from abroad countries.",3,2025-09-21,CBE,Google Play
"The App is very good in its interface and user friendly. But it could be a pro app had it had additional feature that let us run multiple accounts on a single phone with an option of ""additional"" account!",3,2025-09-19,CBE,Google Play
"this app is pretty good. The recent one was the nicest. however after the update, it restricts me from taking a screenshot. i would be happy if you remove screenshots restriction policy from this app. why I gave it five stars was because of the past performances of this app. keep in mind to remove the screenshot restriction policy from this app. and also it has no self authorizations. once uninstalled it needs extra sim cards and wants to visit nearby banks in person.",5,2025-08-20,CBE,Google Play
"I would like to give you some feedback on Current update, its very nice and easy to use👍 but in some button there is still not improved For example while iwant to check my recent Txn it not well sequenced and arranged or some txn may not appear ... becouse of this i see many of users of this app discomferted maily merchants and those make High txn daily. improve and miximize the txn shown to 300 up to 500. make Searchable Recent txn button! All in all the bank i Relly on! CBE my bank !",5,2025-08-29,CBE,Google Play
"The new update is very bugged. can't view the names of account holders I previously had transactions with, and more recently, its almost impossible to load money to telebirr, always says unable to connect...please fix asap",1,2025-08-22,CBE,Google Play
"Amazing, Delightful and Seamless Mobile Banking Application, I have ever Experienced!! Indeed, I feel Great Proud to be part of your Stakeholder! My First Choice Bank, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, The Pioneer and Leading in Digital Banking Services in Ethiopia! Five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ are little to you! Thank you so much🙏",5,2025-09-06,CBE,Google Play
3 stars because I can't see all my transaction history apart from the recents and a refresh button has been removed from the Recents activity. The app should allow clients to view all of the transactions not just recents.,3,2025-10-11,CBE,Google Play
"lately I am facing a problem with the app ,and the problem is when log in and inter my pin it doesn't work at all and says 'can't sync' why does it say that I was working fine a few day ago and also it says when I enter my pin 'change your pin to 6 digit pin and it doesn't allow me to change it please solve what is the problem with the app ?",2,2025-10-04,CBE,Google Play
"The app has a nice design and useful features like balance check and transfers, but it’s unstable and often fails to connect. It also forces users to turn off Developer Options, which is unnecessary — other banking apps work fine without that. Many people use Developer Mode for normal reasons. Please fix performance issues, remove this restriction, and add biometric login for better security and convenience",2,2025-10-19,CBE,Google Play
"it is very nice. but i have a serious suggestion when you send to other cbe birr customer, it does not show the name of the recipient befor it actually send the money. please improve this",4,2025-10-10,CBE,Google Play
"I like the application very much because it is user friendly and makes transactions easiest, especially for business matters. But, these few days I faced difficulties of opening it. I tried to uninstall and re install the app, and re verified at the nearest cbe center. But still failed to use all the functions. It says 'none available'. Any suggestions please!",3,2023-06-05,CBE,Google Play
CBE needs to show transaction fees before the transaction is confirmed and not after. This is a big issue as fees are no longer insignificant.,3,2025-11-03,CBE,Google Play
"I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.",2,2020-09-03,CBE,Google Play
"Application UI and new features are better than the previous version. I found a minor bugs though. I couldn't transfer to an account from the beneficiary list, it says None Available; There is still so much to do with the localization; Instead of ሰኔ it says ጁን and more like this; date conversion is missing also. If this minor things are fixed it will be much better.",3,2020-11-05,CBE,Google Play
"Most of the time, in the 'Recents' button the app becomes stuck and doesn't show up details of transactions and doesn't even scroll down; should be solved. Second, the app doesn't save the last pop-up screen when a transaction is complete. Third, there is no telebirr transfer to other person option and the app by default lets you to only own telebirr transfer.",4,2022-10-06,CBE,Google Play
"it's very nice simple and convenient app! but I have only one comment on double verifications after the finger prints. even thought its good for makin' it more secure, Its not neccessary to double verify after the finger print verification. no need to verify by pin again. thank you!",5,2025-08-22,CBE,Google Play
"The app has some issues I updated recently and now I am not able to send funds to my telebirr wallet, also we need to have a place we save our contacts where we usually send money to, after update I keep loosing all the important accounts.",4,2025-08-23,CBE,Google Play
"This app stooped working after i updated it. It says change password and i did, but it doesn't open with the new password. I don't like it.",1,2025-08-23,CBE,Google Play
"URGENT FIX REQUIRED!!! The app does not work anymore! Account balance is not displayed. Trying to use any service on the app shows error ""None available"". What is the point of an internet/mobile banking app if you cannot carry out banking services from your fingertips? I also don't want to reinstall because CBE activation code can only be recieved in the bank, which sounds very ridiculous. These days, banks send OTP to email, so customers can manage their account anywhere in the world.",1,2023-12-26,CBE,Google Play
"The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.",2,2024-09-04,CBE,Google Play
"Still needs development on several features.... For example - bank statements available online. The text feature of available balance and debited/credited notifications is very old school and involves too much digital trail. App doesn't always work, could be due to network issues in Ethiopia though. Another major issue is an error message is displayed when transferring from CBE to other banks. Ive almost lost a few thousands doing this once. Always cross check your balances.",1,2024-08-27,CBE,Google Play
"I think it is a good app to use easily. However, I have one more comment: the app does not automatically sync or update the balance in real time. Please review this issue. For example, when someone transfers money, the receiver's app does not sync automatically. It requires the user to manually initiate an update to see the current balance.",4,2025-09-04,CBE,Google Play
the app constantly glitches and won't stop loading despite having a decent connection and a cleared cache. telebirr is way better,1,2025-11-10,CBE,Google Play
"With each update the app is getting slower and slower, specially when requesting transaction history. And I wish the logging process could be done easily. When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the ""Own telebirr"" option. It id very limiting now a days",4,2023-08-11,CBE,Google Play
The upgread is perfect and loved the new system could be accessed from any branch if u face problem in the application. The other thing if possible to add would be to expand the number of transaction be looked for all transaction back to a month period at list this will help review most transactions if there needs any review. The only problem I saw is that once a phone number is attached to another bank account # you need to provide another phone number to get the service. The rest is excellent,4,2020-07-31,CBE,Google Play
"Suddenly the cbe application I was using stopped working and called callcenter, I was told it's because it expired and I should vist any branch to fix it. So I went to CBE Silassie branch.After filling a form they gave me, I sat down and waited until they finish fixing 2 customer's case who arrived before me. But then when it was my turn ppl who came after me with same mobile banking and even Atm card cases were finishing up and leaving I had to get back to my work so I left.with no service.why?",1,2025-10-16,CBE,Google Play
The app is user friendly. But i want some amendment or include option of sending money to other tele birr like other cbe birr.,4,2025-09-18,CBE,Google Play
This app dash board is disturbing me. it is not showing me traxation and my balance while displaying others option on dashboard. I think it is a risk full app😭😭😭🤤🤤,1,2025-10-15,CBE,Google Play
it will be more better if the app have the feature receipt verifying from QR CODE SCREENSHOT IMAGES FROM gallery ... currently IT WORKS ONLY FROM DIRECT CAMERA CAPTURING,4,2025-09-23,CBE,Google Play
its easy to use and more secured than the previous one. i love it and appreciate commercial bank of ethiopia for every time update.,5,2025-10-16,CBE,Google Play
this app is very useful but sometimes when you want to see specific transactions it didn't work so that way i gave 3,3,2025-09-20,CBE,Google Play
It is amazing app but it is more better if it is possible to transfer from account to other telebirr,5,2025-09-22,CBE,Google Play
"I am trying to access this app on my Android phone, but sometimes doesn't work. so kindly try to improve it.",3,2025-10-07,CBE,Google Play
"The most unreliable banking app i ever used, the transactions are stuck halfway and i can't access my money then when you call the call center they ask that you wait 3-5 business days before they return the money what is the point off having a banking app if the transactions are unreliable and incomplete I'd rate less if i could.",1,2025-06-25,CBE,Google Play
"once it is uninstalled, you need to visit a nearby bank. you go there and they ask you to have a new sim card which hasn't been used before. so you should buy a new sim card and you go back to them with a new sim card, when you reach there service provider says authentication pin is not arrive, the system is not working come back tomorrow.",1,2025-11-05,CBE,Google Play
"The app is awesome. But there are many things to highlight.For example, When spending money from the account , a confirmation text message must be sent to the account holder. Also the fact that, the PIN is only four digits is not safe enough for security, if it is more than eight digits and includes numbers and symbols, it will be cool.",3,2023-01-29,CBE,Google Play
"The previous version is much better than this one. I used it for more than six years without any problem. But now I'm having a serious trouble with the updated app. I don't know why it takes him forever to refresh and load the home page once you sign in. And if it fails to load, it never recovers. I only see some UI changes. Really disappointed",2,2021-01-01,CBE,Google Play
"In fact, it's a good app to make our daily life easier! However, I have encountered several times issues with this app. 1. It's not always working with network error, even though the network is good on my phone. 2. It happened to me several times that when I transfer money to someone's account, I doubled the transfer! Or in another word, my money sent two times. If I wanted to send 10,000, I found that sent 20,000 because of the APP error. I hope this will be fixed soon.",1,2023-09-04,CBE,Google Play
"everytime you uninstall the app you have to reach them out physically. very oldy! if that's one of security layer, they'd check for fraud attempt via app source directly(source:- app store, play store ... etc) implicitly ! we are in 2025, physical presence for every app install is traditional(traditionally very rare).",1,2025-06-04,CBE,Google Play
doesn't work unless with data doesn't refresh fast other wise functions ok but after the update transferring to telebirr is not working,2,2025-08-23,CBE,Google Play
"It's very good in reminding the account numbers you have been used, but Need to show recipient history whenever you want to present it.or it has to have a search on options for a spesfic time you want to look for receipts with out going for account details at bank. if you lost your receipt without downloading it and need to look sometime a while you can't get in simple search on the app.",1,2025-02-15,CBE,Google Play
"Its hard to trust this application coz while transfering money it transfers two times to the same account after only one transfer click and sometimes it says error but it actualy have transfered the money, so i only use it if it is mandatory unless its better to go to the bank, so it still doesn't solve the problem not to go to the bank, i am sure it have some systematic errors",1,2022-03-01,CBE,Google Play
"It is a very basic app. Banks nowadays offer many services through their app. I suggest you add the abilty to get statements, the ability to freeze the card if stolen or when traveling. The abilty to use the card while traveling. I have noticed that if Ieave Ethiopia it is not possible to pay my bills back home. So in general the app is very helpful and eased the burden of carrying money arroubd in Ethiopia, please improve it further.",4,2023-07-24,CBE,Google Play
It works very well. I have two issues though 1/ it is not possible to transfer accounts in other Banks. 2/ the exoress money sending function dies not work as neither the recipient nor the sender get the secret number but the money will alrwady be sent. I had to go throgh a very lengthy process to get the money back with the transfer fee already deducted. In the end I lost three days plus the transfer fee for teying to send money fast. Other than these issues it does the rest of the job well.,3,2021-09-15,CBE,Google Play
"Currently the app is not working becuase I think they forgot to update it. It always shows'sync failed''. And there is no customer service online. People living abroad are having problems. It is a big shame. It is very annoying and not user friendly, People are using CBE just becuase salary is transferd there. The app is a total failur.",1,2022-02-06,CBE,Google Play
"I have been using this app for more than a year it came with best version, but now after the last update it's not working well as before. It can't sync, the connection is not working at all. I can't see recent transactions and make any transfer , all the features are not working, I hope you will come with a better update soon.",2,2020-09-12,CBE,Google Play
"This app has several issues based on my experience. Below are the problems that I encountered: 1. The app frequently crashes. 2. It only shows a limited transaction record history (25 transactions). 3. You can't access the transaction records after 8:00 pm and on Sundays. 4. It displays a ""payment failed"" message. It would be greatly appreciated if you could address these issues",1,2024-08-25,CBE,Google Play
"Sometimes it brings a contradicting notifications. First I saw an internet poll form. After I filled it, another message comes that advises users not fill any forms sent or bank did not send such documents. Sometimes the app gets stack without any prior notices. It happened quite numerical times with me. Otherwise great app. I think a followup maintenance and improvements needed",3,2024-03-09,CBE,Google Play
"Poor application. Let me list down if you could update the main features. It say error while the money has already sent. We can't get the transaction record (it has limited date) or somtimes the listed record transactions and the details are not the same while we enter to see further details. So if you can, try to see telebirr application and how much simple it is then try to update frequently.",1,2024-07-02,CBE,Google Play
The app keeps on crushing & I can't log in or access my account. Went to the bank for trouble shooting. The customer service was very poor and I told to reinstall the app and enter new activation key. I did and after starting to work for few hours again the prob is there and the app is still crushing and not working. Such poor service is unexpected from a big statd owned bank. You should fix the problem ASAP.,1,2019-03-06,CBE,Google Play
"I love this app. It's simple to use and syncs fast. The only issue I had was the balance shows only what's on the ledger, there is no way to tell what the actual balance is. I learn about the difference between the two balance types the hard way on an ATM machine. I would love to see that fixed in your next update.",5,2021-09-25,CBE,Google Play
"It is a nice app compared to the previous one. I appreciate you have included local language but the details in the Amharic section will return to English mode, please fix that problem plus additional local language will increase its usability. Also it would be nice if the terms and conditions agreements, security tips, charge and transfer limits.... are included in the app.",4,2020-07-26,CBE,Google Play
"The 'unsubscribe' button in the CBE Android app is misplaced. It should be at the middle of the menu or somewhere else rather than at the end. The end is usually for a 'log out"" and I inadvertently touched ''unsubscribe"" many times. This could lead to customers accidentally unsubscribing from the service.",4,2024-11-11,CBE,Google Play
"It's a great app. I've been using this app since the bank launched it. As a long-term user, I would like to point out things that need to be improved. 1. Deleting money transfer history should be the user's choice. 2. There should be an option to download an in-depth transfer history for each transfer activity , just as there is posiblity to download a single time transfer recit. Do that and get 5 star.",3,2022-03-18,CBE,Google Play
"It is a service that is not expected from such a large institution. I saw that your work is very complicated. The user does not understand well your application. In general, you have many problems. This application is not convenient for the end user. For instance I can't access my account from abroad what I depsited amount and transfer from my account to any any one .It is a shame.",1,2024-10-16,CBE,Google Play
"It is a good and progressive app through the updates. I think the app should further solve its bugs like 1. It doesn't download or share attachment on android 12 and 11, it used to work on android 10. 2. Sometimes transactions seem like they have failed and there are no records, but the transactions actually have passed this is a very serious issue, because people will try the transaction again which will end up doubling the payment.",4,2022-09-15,CBE,Google Play
"I really love this app,it is amazing. It is more flexible than any other banks app. The only and main problem that I encountered with this app is,if it is uninstalled from this devices, I have to go to the bank and mostly the specific barank the account is opened to reconfigur again. This is very unpractical in most cases,since people are traveling and very busy in their day to day activities. Kindly consider to change this option.",5,2023-09-11,CBE,Google Play
"This application is really bad. It is slow and doesn't work properly. It doesn't show recent activities. Using this app I transfered money to a friend and after showing deduction on my account, the money didn't reach the other end,the activity is not reflected on my recent transactions either. The worst app ever. It doesn't work outside of Ethiopia.",1,2021-05-31,CBE,Google Play
as if the update of march 19 i can't take a screenshot in the app. i can just save it as file and that is so annoying. i used to save all screenshot in my gallery in one folder now with the extra steps added i have to save the file go to file and then screenshot it. the solution is to allow the screenshot to be save in to gallery automatically. i wish you give this review attention and resolve the issue shortly.,2,2025-03-19,CBE,Google Play
"I'm blind. I have been using this service since 2008 EC. More or less both versions are accessible to our screen reader, talkback. However, after updating the app, its account tab couldn't display second account which is connected via CBE account. Secondly after transfering money, it shows save and share options but doesn't work.",3,2022-05-23,CBE,Google Play
"Good mobile banking application except some bugs. For instance, when I transfer money from account to account, an error message called 'already existed account' appears. But the money was transferred without any confirmation message. If I was not aware of that, I tried multiple times and sent the money multiple times too.",5,2023-01-06,CBE,Google Play
"Really I troubled to use this application since last week, I've been using it more than 2 years. I don't know what's wrong with it now. It can't synchronize, even can't see any update in my account. I tried to repair and manage in setting, but not possible. Also you don't have any means of online communication/ chat. Could you please tell me what to do?",4,2021-04-18,CBE,Google Play
"I'll give 5 stars when the app has the function to see more than just a couple of transactions. Right now, you can not even go back one month and see prior transaction. That is a standard banking function that also CBE should have. Because of that only 1 Start.",1,2025-06-25,CBE,Google Play
"I have bad experience since I started using this app. I get ""none available "" error message while there is good internet connection. And I went to my branch two times to activate the app. There should be some way to activate without physically going to the branch. Anyway, it should be improved much from what it is now!!!",1,2021-05-02,CBE,Google Play
Easy to use and a lot of functionalities! Keep your eyes on two things: 1. The transactions shown in the Recent section are messed up (every time I refresh it it shows different output of order and messed transaction list) 2. What if we can transfer to other Telebirr number Finally the transaction fee for transfers made other than CBE acc is expensive.,4,2024-05-28,CBE,Google Play
this is absolute trash why because it's not Woking most time the servers are down even though I'm using 4g data Internet they steal not working they use to work with out even data package now it's trash can't even send money,1,2025-11-09,CBE,Google Play
"fast and convenient app, thanks for your dedication as a bank to provide good options to your cuatomers.",1,2025-11-19,CBE,Google Play
not allowing to transfer and showing current statement updates.,1,2025-11-19,CBE,Google Play
"I have seen lots of issues on this app one of them is you can't use them in multiple device and you have to go to the place you opened your account in order to get mobile banking even if you change you device you have to go to the branch to activate it, why can't you just make it easy like the others banking system in Ethiopia. You should learn from abbisinia and dashen to be honest",1,2022-10-18,CBE,Google Play
"The app is good. However, whenever you changed your phone it requires authorization ID, approaching a branch is mandatory. The password reset option should be available to the user by adding other security details like user name, biometrics, account number, etc.",3,2023-03-10,CBE,Google Play
"It only works at the first glance(only after installation and configuration). After that all the transfer options, utilities, top up doesn't work. It just say doesn't sync. Even the balance bord keeps loading and doesn't show the current balance.... Very poor experience ☹️😥.",1,2020-09-05,CBE,Google Play
"The old one was very bad and clumsy. every time I tried to login there was a problem with synchronization, because of that I was close to clear my account from CBE and open a new one in privet bank, as they cares about their customers. In other hand the new one is perfect and shows a little bit reformation in the Headquarter and this makes us to trust this bank again.",4,2020-08-01,CBE,Google Play
"The app is not friendly usable . For example, it asks you verification key as soon as you download it. There is no description where or how to get verification key. This is crazy. I never seen any app ask you verification key at the start . confusing app. No more try waste of time.",1,2020-11-11,CBE,Google Play
"I have not seen anything like it in the Ethiopian banking industry. It is very easy to use, fast, and offers a wide range of services. However, I would like to suggest a future modification: currently, the app only displays transactions for one month. It would be beneficial if it could show transactions for more than one month, including yearly transactions. Please consider this request. Thank you, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, for this innovative app.",5,2024-07-19,CBE,Google Play
"It is a great app so far specially the speed is good. But it is important to know who send you money, so you should also show the sender's name if the receiver is in the sender's beneficiary list, because it shows the nick name of the receiver not the sender's name. Thank you.",5,2023-05-23,CBE,Google Play
Good app but it fail to send on time the commission money is unnecessary and also their are some bug like recent transaction page don't show the recent one ...... Try to improve it's back system as a bank system people want it in different situations so it has to work every time as could as possible if you don't get it when you want why we use mobile banking not branch service as I conclusion personally I like the bank because it is CBE but not their digital banking system Thanks,2,2024-05-12,CBE,Google Play
"Since I started using this app it. Really helped me a lot. The CBE started some years ago and it is good progress, other foreign banks has money years experience and and the technology is theirs. Yes some inconvenience can occur the bank have to simplify it fast. Keep on going!!!",4,2022-12-15,CBE,Google Play
"The recent update automatically turns the developers option on, and when one starts the app, a message pops up saying the app does not work with the developers option on. So, one has to go to the settings and manually turn the developers option off. Otherwise the app doesn't work.",3,2025-01-01,CBE,Google Play
this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,CBE,Google Play
"App needs lots of updates to accomodate more demographic for Ethiopians leaving overseas. - Ability to use user name and password to use the application. People leaving over seas if they lose their phone, they can't have access to the application again unless u got to Ethiopia and activated it on the new phone! That's rediocoulus. - This application seems like it's a transfer application, not a bank application.

It is a a much better App than other Private Banks. But you have to include the following options; 1. The Bank Statement should be Unlimited. It should allow to see all Transactions by Tracing Back. No Need to Limit it with only one Page Transaction (May be 10Page). 2. You have to Work on transferring Money to other Banks too. You can ask additional payment for it. But the Service will be Essential for Us.,5,2021-09-21,CBE,Google Play

"@Shewangizaw L. As a heavy user of the app , the issue you raised around resetting pass pin concerned me and gave it a try and found it to be safe. Basically the app will do two things: verifies one using an otp and then requires an in-person visit to bank's physical branch for final verification after resetting the password. Therefore, safe to use! I wish ""i""nformational tip was added around the reset button. Could not attach screenshot.",4,2025-10-06,Dashen,Google Play
